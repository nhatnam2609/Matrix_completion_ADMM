# Matrix Completion using ADMM

This repository implements a low-rank matrix completion algorithm using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). The implementation is particularly focused on recommendation systems applications, such as movie rating predictions.

## Problem Description

Matrix completion is the problem of recovering missing entries in a partially observed matrix. In recommendation systems:
- Users rate only a small subset of items
- The rating matrix B has missing entries
- Goal: Predict missing ratings based on observed ones
- Key assumption: Rating matrix has low rank due to limited factors influencing user preferences

Mathematically, we solve:
```
minimize    rank(X)
subject to  X ≥ 0
            X_ij = B_ij, ∀(i,j) ∈ Ω
```
where Ω is the set of observed entries.

## Solution Approach

The solution involves several key steps:

1. **Problem Relaxation**
   - Replace rank minimization with nuclear norm minimization
   - Convert to convex optimization problem
   - Apply ADMM for efficient solving

2. **ADMM Algorithm**
   - Split problem into simpler subproblems
   - Iterate between X-update and Y-update steps
   - Use SVD for nuclear norm proximal operator

3. **Implementation Details**
   - Matrix factorization via SVD
   - Projection operators for constraints
   - Soft thresholding for nuclear norm

## Usage

```matlab
% Generate test data
